## Overview

This project aims to create multiple retro-style 8-bit computers based on the 65C02 microprocessor. The project is centered around a number of custom-designed PCBs that can be combined in various configurations to create different computer systems based on a common [memory map](./Assets/Documents/Memory%20Map/Memory%20Map.pdf). The designs are inspired by classic 8-bit computers such as the KIM-1, Commodore 64, and Apple II, but with modern enhancements and flexibility.

The project is designed using **KiCad 7.0+** for PCB design and is **open-source** under the CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Permissive, allowing enthusiasts to contribute and modify the designs freely. The boards are manufactured by **JLCPCB** and use a combination of surface-mount and through-hole components for optimal assembly flexibility.

### Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Mix and match boards, cards, and helpers to create custom configurations
- **Multiple System Types**: Build a desktop computer (COB), development emulator (DEV), or gaming console (VCS)
- **Common Memory Map**: All systems share a consistent memory architecture for software compatibility
- **Modern Manufacturing**: Optimized for JLCPCB's assembly services with production-ready files included
- **Open-Source Hardware**: Complete KiCad schematics, PCB layouts, and 3D models available
- **Extensive Firmware**: PlatformIO-based firmware for microcontrollers with networking, USB, and storage support
- **Flexible I/O**: Support for PS/2 keyboards, joysticks, serial terminals, video output (composite/VGA), and more

## Design Philosophy

The ac6502 project is guided by several core principles:

### 1. **Modularity & Flexibility**
Rather than designing monolithic systems, the project uses interchangeable boards, cards, and helpers that can be combined in different ways. This allows a single set of PCBs to create vastly different computer systems.

### 2. **Modern Manufacturing Meets Retro Design**
While the systems are inspired by 1970s-1980s computers like the KIM-1 and Commodore 64, they leverage modern PCB manufacturing capabilities (SMD components, JLCPCB assembly) and contemporary components (Teensy microcontrollers, Pi Pico, modern VIAs).

### 3. **Common Architecture**
All systems share a common memory map and bus structure. This ensures that software written for one system can often run on another with minimal modifications, and peripherals remain compatible across configurations.

### 4. **Open-Source Everything**
Complete transparency: all schematics, PCB layouts, 3D models, firmware source code, and production files are available under permissive open-source licenses. The community can learn from, modify, and improve any aspect of the project.

### 5. **Real Hardware + Emulation**
The project supports both real 65C02 hardware and accurate cycle-by-cycle emulation (via Teensy 4.1 + vrEmu6502). This provides flexibility for software development and testing without requiring physical chips.

### 6. **Educational Focus**
Documentation, schematics, and code are written with clarity in mind. The project serves as a learning platform for understanding computer architecture, digital design, and embedded programming.

### The DEV (Development Environment Vehicle)

**Type:** Emulation-based development system  
**Complexity:** Intermediate  
**Best For:** Software developers and debugging workflows

![The DEV](./Assets/Images/DEV.png?raw=true)

The DEV replaces the physical 65C02 CPU with a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller running cycle-accurate emulation via [vrEmu6502](https://github.com/visrealm/vrEmu6502).

**Required Components:**
  * 1x Dev Board (Teensy 4.1-based 65C02 emulator)
  * 1x Dev Output Board (2.4" LCD with TMS9918A VDP and SID audio emulation)

**Key Features:**
- Cycle-accurate 65C02 emulation (no physical CPU needed)
- Teensy 4.1 platform (600 MHz ARM Cortex-M7)
- Variable CPU speed
- Ethernet connectivity via QNEthernet library
- Web-based control interface (DB Emulator) accessible at `http://6502.local`
- SD card support for loading ROMs, programs, and saving snapshots
- USB-C keyboard and joystick input (Xbox 360/One controllers)
- Serial terminal interface (115200 baud)
- mDNS discovery
- Real-time clock support
- Hardware buttons (Run/Stop, Step, Reset, Frequency)

**Development Advantages:**
- No need to burn ROMs for testing
- Step through code cycle-by-cycle
- Load programs instantly from SD card or network
- Monitor memory in real-time via web interface
- Snapshot memory (Save memory state to SD card)

**See Also:** [Firmware/DB Emulator/README.md](./Firmware/DB%20Emulator/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**IMPORTANT:**

The DEV does not output bus compatible signals (or any signals) for the ac6502 backplane system with the current firmware and instead relies entirely on emulation. There is a bus connector and a card slot available on the Dev Board along with level shifters for all signals (see schematic). These are up to end-user to implement if you want to try to talk to real hardware using the bus connections. In past versions of the firmware (see commit history) I have worked with real hardware and it does work so give it try if you would like!

- 512KB total RAM organized as two 256KB banks
- Bank selection via single latch at $83FF or $87FF (write 0-255)
- Writing to latch selects which 1KB window (of 256) appears at IO 1 and IO 2
- IO 1 ($8000-$83FF): 1KB window into first 256KB bank
- IO 2 ($8400-$87FF): 1KB window into second 256KB bank
- Both windows show the same bank number from their respective 256KB regions
- Allows access to full 512KB by switching between 256 different 1KB windows

### Bus Structure

The ac6502 bus includes:
- **16-bit Address Bus** (A0-A15): Addresses up to 64KB memory space
- **8-bit Data Bus** (D0-D7): Bidirectional data transfer
- **Control Signals**:
  - `RW` (Read/Write): Direction of data transfer (1=Read, 0=Write)
  - `PHI2` (Clock): System clock signal (0.5-8 MHz typical)
  - `RESET`: System reset (active low)
  - `IRQ`: Interrupt request (active low)
  - `NMI`: Non-maskable interrupt (active low)
  - `RDY`: Ready signal for clock stretching
  - `SYNC`: Instruction fetch indicator

### Clock & Reset Circuitry

**Clock Generation:**
- Oscillator: Crystal or ceramic resonator (1-8 MHz typical)
- Clock can be:
  - Free-running (normal operation)
  - Single-stepped (via Clock Helper)
  - Variable frequency (firmware in DEV)
- Clock Helper provides:
  - Run/Stop control
  - Single cycle stepping
  - Single instruction stepping

**Reset Circuit:**
- Power-on reset via RC circuit (Main Board or Backplane Pro)
- Manual reset button
- Watchdog timer reset (optional, via RTC Card)

### Interrupt Handling

- **IRQ (Maskable Interrupt)**: Used by serial (65C51), timers (65C22), and other peripherals
- **NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt)**: Currently unused but can be configured on some cards
- Interrupt vectors stored at `$FFFA-$FFFF` in ROM

### Address Decoding

Each peripheral card uses address decoding logic to respond only to its assigned memory range:
- **I/O Cards**: Use 74HC138 3-to-8 decoder with address lines A15-A10, jumper-selectable for flexibility
- **Main Board & Memory Card**: Use 74HC00 NAND for RAM/ROM chip select
- Jumpers or DIP switches allow I/O address reconfiguration on cards

**Example:** Serial Card (65C51 ACIA)
- Occupies 4 bytes in I/O space ($9000-$9003, IO 5)
- 74HC138 decoder uses A15-A10 to select I/O slot
- Address decoder activates chip enable when A15-A10 match configured slot
- Lower address bits (A1-A0) select specific ACIA registers

1. **Start with Template**:
   - Use existing card design as template (copy folder structure)
   - OR use blank template from Templates/ folder

2. **Define Requirements**:
   - What functionality does the card provide?
   - What I/O address range will it occupy?
   - What connectors are needed?
   - Power consumption estimate

3. **Schematic Design**:
   - Create multi-sheet schematic if complex
   - Use ac6502 Parts library for common components
   - Include address decoding logic
   - Add bus buffers if driving bus signals
   - Follow existing card conventions for connector pinouts

4. **PCB Layout**:
   - Match card edge connector footprint to backplane
   - Place connectors for easy access
   - Route power planes (4-layer board) or wide power traces (2-layer)
   - Maintain signal integrity (short traces for high-speed signals)
   - Add mounting holes (if applicable)

5. **Verify Design Rules**:
   - Run DRC with JLCPCB design rules
   - Check trace widths (minimum 0.15mm for outer layers)
   - Check clearances (minimum 0.15mm)
   - Verify drill sizes (minimum 0.3mm)

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update README with card description
   - Add to Board Compatibility Matrix
   - Create schematic PDF
   - Document I/O addresses and register map

7. **Build and Test**:
   - Order prototype
   - Test all functionality
   - Update Testing Status when verified

### Firmware Development

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd Firmware/<ProjectName>
   pio init   # If creating new project
   ```

2. **Write Code**:
   - Follow existing firmware structure
   - Use libraries when available (ArduinoJson, Bounce2, etc.)
   - Comment code thoroughly
   - Use meaningful variable/function names

3. **Build and Test**:
   ```bash
   pio run                      # Build
   pio run --target upload      # Upload to microcontroller
   pio device monitor           # Monitor serial output
   ```

4. **Debug**:
   - Add debug print statements
   - Use serial monitor to observe behavior
   - Test edge cases (invalid inputs, boundary conditions)

5. **Document**:
   - Update firmware README with features
   - Document API/registers (for microcontrollers acting as peripherals)
   - Add comments explaining complex logic

### Contributing CAD Designs

1. **Create Enclosure**:
   - Measure assembled boards accurately
   - Design in Fusion 360, OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, or similar
   - Allow clearances for connectors, cables, ventilation
   - Include mounting holes for standoffs

2. **Export Models**:
   - STL for 3D printing
   - STEP for CAD interchange

3. **Test Print**:
   - Print prototype (PLA or PETG recommended)
   - Verify fit with actual boards
   - Iterate as needed

4. **Commit to Repository**:
   ```bash
   git add CAD/<EnclosureName>/
   git commit -m "Add enclosure for <SystemName>"
   git push
   ```
